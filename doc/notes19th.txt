###HDF5view
especially useful for metadata
* littel red a tlls you the attributes that are there
* youc can programmatically pull out metadata info into your environment

in reflectance data there is also the meteorological conditions on th esite >> can be used to use for unceratinty

hey, the real band is 5, but it is actually taking some info from a  gaussian. Than means that even if the band is 5nm, it is getting some of the 6th nm 


clipIndex = neon.calc_clip_index(clipExt,sercRefl_md['ext_dict'])

serc_b56_subset = subset_clean_band(sercRefl,sercRefl_md,clipIndex,55)
refl_band = serc_b56_subset

w = copy.copy(wavelengths.value)
w[((w >= 1340) & (w <= 1445)) | ((w >= 1790) & (w <= 1955))]=np.nan
interact(spectraPlot, pixel_x = (0,refl.shape[1]-1,1),pixel_y=(0,refl.shape[0]-1,1))

gaussian weighting scheme to get the average: cover 4 or 5 bands to average with but still under construction


now think about what branch you are using, which the repo on cloud is
check in "branch" in the git hub page on their repo

git branch -a
	it is basically just telling me 
	
	git pull upstream master
	git push origin master 
		> not gonna move everything. Just the things that changed since last time I checked in
	git log 
		> you can get what happened every time. Important to have a nice 
	q
		> get out of the log
	
now if you go on the site, you have the same thing
