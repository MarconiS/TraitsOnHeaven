geolocation uncertainty
horizontal uncertainty greater than vertical
uncertainty specifications pretty "optimistic"
vegetation affects
processing > larger and difficult to quantify
distance from the base station is the most important factor
over 20km raise a lot. below, 0.02m uncertainty
LMS processing. 30% overlapping. See how data overlap
> system in very good allignment >> y = 0 +- 0.05 CI

vertical error ( calculated usign ground truth gps) > N(0, 0.05 ish) (95% in +-0.1) 0.02 to 0.11 st.dev
horizontal accuracy ~ N(0, )
 > beam divergence laser pulse
 > enegry pulse distribution Normal
 > wide beam (80cmish) > shift of 40cm in giving height of the edge to the center
 > gps error and other stuff is less influential > beam divergence the real big guy
 
mean error 0.04m to 0.06

uncertainty rebuilt using Goulden et al 2010, algoritmh uses subsystem LiDAR error >> 

3by3 moving average
lot of noise in the lidar points: running a 3by3 moving average >> you get rid of part of the noise by smoothing
generlly underestimating tree height using lidar (negative itercept)

> you get the return a little bit down, uncertainty around 0.4m
> using the different paths > a different chm, and see what is the uncertainty given they are calculating the chm from different datasets

around 1 to 2 m of sd
edges of the tree have a lot of variation and uncertainty
look at the overlapping point clouds to get uncertainty once you are using it to estimate the ITCs

at the most interpolating 3 meters when creating the chm
heavy canopy, we are interpolating up to 25m > because of the less frequency of ground points

processing unceratinty depending on day qulity, +- 0.3
misclassification : top of the montains
misclassification of vegetation points
classification 90%
simulated errors is giving just the sensor error, not the interaction with the point cloud

dat portal and documents >> 2 different "sub-portals"
chm rasters not a great way to look into things. I guess for what we are interested, point cloud is quite better to work with
look at how fast a tree grow, how much is getting from the error: you can see early changes 
> uncertainty analisys of lidar for height interpretation: get how big is a crown with respect of how much of uncertainty you got there



hsp: wavelength with different uncertainty
monocromator scanner (and ghosts)
bleeding of white (lots of reflectance and blurring) on the black tarp goes away 
uncertainty 5% per radiance

NIS1 and NIS2 have different bands: you gotta standardize them 
get rid of tfirst 10 and last 10


brdf corrections >> they will be applied but still not there. You can use SNV to standardize the shadows
ORNL 2016 >> may be another nice source of data
Moisture stress index,
NDII, 
NDWI
PRI, 
Normalized difference lignin difference
NDNI

landcover impact on indexes (is it worthy use them directly?)
