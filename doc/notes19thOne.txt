#notes workshop 19 june
there is an api and a python package to diretly interface with it. Use it to download the data we need
external repos: AEREONET PhenoCam and OpenTopography
>> up to 2016 
>> get data for external sites to use the payload3 for
>> remember when you have teh occasion to ask veg data: where? citrix or data portal?
>focus of NEON people is the L0 >> l1 
we are taking pics once a year > translate from ground to regional across scales
can you translate the ground info to spatial?
380 2510 6nm
rgb compliment of hps data: camera has the same as 52, 34, 18

purple ext boundaries >>  dem
interior portions outlines in purple > trouble with idar data?
name of each file name_n.visit_UTM.meters.lower_left.corner.image
RGB camera is not in 3 layers: just camera images as if it is a classic pic

hdf5 format info:
netcdf4 is an api of hdf:
information is data + metadata + structure

etadata throughout the file 
lv1 >lv2 >>lv3
mt.1 mt.2  mt.3

BAG : batimetric altitude grid
> several grids >> there is a list of changes as a table held inthe file
> las >> now more interested in waweform >> getting to the point to get the h5 there too?


hardlinks and softlinks in hdf5
pytable/pandas interface to hdf5 can make fast queries to hdf5 
OPENDAP > check 
.mat ~ hdf5
hdf5 is for lovers vimeeo
mathmatica reads and has a hdf5 tool
bioconductor >> R convoluton repo for several different studies
EC tools for R? che ck it better and see how to get it
hdf4 mapper >> creates an xml map of hte structure of the data
HDFCompass >> pyhton tool
HDF-EOS Dumper
import the EML in the h5>> what's the meaning?

higly scalabe data storage (??) HSDS > check
give a measure of traits as a product of NEON data: seems they'd be excited to fund external data processes


uncertainty estimats
expanded uncertainty flag: several components to measure uncertainty; not exactly everything.
EC will include a more holistic way to quanity uncertainty
rasters of uncertainty: currently in development

level0/1
no urban sites: rural yes
new R parckage > wrapper forr ht e API


check aviris or other hps data at lower resolution but bigger extent
clorophyll is related to NIR reflectance > healthy ~ reflNIR
the water absorption is the same at each site
data from tarps used to quantify the uuncertainty
SAVI = (p850 - p650 ) * 1.5/(850 +  650 + 0.5)

LAI = -1/0.6 ln(.82 - SAVI / 0.78)
fPAR = C[1-Aexp(-BLAI)] A =  1, B = .4, C= 1
Albedo product
